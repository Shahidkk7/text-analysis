# Text Analysis Tool 🧠📊

This is a Python-based **Text Analysis Tool** that takes a user-input block of text and returns useful statistics along with visualizations. It is built as part of a modular programming assignment with intentional prompting methodology.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts raw user input from the terminal
- Cleans and processes text
- Calculates:
  - Total word count
  - Sentence count
  - Average word length
  - Most frequent words
- Visualizes top 5 words using a bar chart
- Menu-based navigation using `pyinputplus`
- Modular function-based structure

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - `pyinputplus`
  - `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pyinputplus matplotlib
```

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Run the script:
```bash
python text_analysis_tool.py
```

2. Follow the menu prompts:
   - Enter your text
   - View statistics
   - Generate a bar chart
   - Exit when done

## 📁 Project Structure

- `text_analysis_tool.py` — Main Python script
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions

## 📓 AI Prompting Journey

This project was built by following a 6-step intentional prompting process using ChatGPT:
1. Restate the problem
2. Identify input/output
3. Manually solve a sample
4. Request pseudocode
5. Convert to Python
6. Test edge cases

## 🧠 Reflection

The development journey focused more on the **process** than the final product — simulating edge cases, refining logic, and collaborating with AI to improve modularity, clarity, and error-handling.
